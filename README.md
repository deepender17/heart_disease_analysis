Heart Disease Analysis and Prediction Using Machine Learning
Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

Introduction
Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others. The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease."Cardiovascular disease refers to conditions characterized by narrowed or blocked blood vessels, which can result in a heart attack, chest pain (angina), or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those affecting your heart's muscle, valves, or rhythm, are also classified as heart disease. any types of heart disease can be avoided or treated by adopting a healthy lifestyle.

Symptoms
Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)
Shortness of breath
Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed
Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back

# Objective(s)

With the dataset provided for heart analysis, we have to analyse the possibilities of heart attack on the basis of various features, and then the prediction from the analysis will tell us that whether an individual is prone to heart attack or not.
The detailed analysis can proceed with the exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The classification for predication can be done using various machine learning model algorithms, choose the best suited model for heart attack analysis and finally save the model in the pickle (.pkl) file.
